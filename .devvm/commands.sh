# Project commands for devvm (sourced by devvm; see its README, "Project configuration").
#
# A virtual desktop in the VM for trying modama-agent-gui, its session helper and mount
# popup by hand or from scripts: Xvfb with openbox and xfce4-panel, widgets driven by
# name over AT-SPI (ui.py), the tray icon over D-Bus (tray.py), screenshots to the host.
# The tools live in .devvm/guest/desktop/ and are copied into the VM by every command.

DESKTOP_TOOLS_VM=.local/share/modama-desktop   # in the VM user's home

PROJECT_USAGE+="  desktop-setup     install the virtual desktop's packages and Rust in the VM (once)
  desktop-up [panel|watcher|none]
                    start the desktop :1 with a notification area: xfce4-panel (default),
                    a D-Bus stand-in for tray.py, or none
  desktop-modama    enroll an agent with the test deployment's CA (once) and start
                    modama-agent and modama-agent-gui on the desktop; needs deploy/uptest.sh
                    and a release build in the VM's checkout
  desktop-shot [FILE]
                    save a screenshot of the desktop on the host (default:
                    \${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/devvm-desktop.png)
  desktop-vnc       forward the desktop's VNC server to localhost:5900 on the host
  ui ARGS...        drive widgets by name over AT-SPI (ui.py; devvm ui --help)
  tray ARGS...      read and click the tray icon over D-Bus (tray.py; devvm tray --help)
  xdo ARGS...       xdotool on the desktop, e.g. devvm xdo mousemove 100 200 click 1
  desktop-drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2
                    drag with the left button from X1,Y1 to X2,Y2 in steps, as a hand does
  bench-setup       install the crawl benchmark's NFS server and I/O tools in the VM (once;
                    python/crawler/benchmark/README.md)"
