    Check if :code:`groupname` can become a new Unix group

    The concept for projects includes "proper" projects that have their own Unix
    group. To keep an overview over many active projects, it will be beneficial
    to have identical folder and group names.

    Furthermore, ad-hoc projects can be created by users on-demand and control
    access via per-user ACLs. That allows creating projects immediately, without
    having to wait for the IFF admins to create the group.

    For large projects with many members it will be easier to manage access via
    group membership. Likely, many "proper" projects will start their life as
    ad-hoc projects and will be migrated to a group. Therefore we should already
    make sure that a new group with the project name can be created later.

    Criteria:
    * Does not collide with system groups. Probably we should curate
    that as a list later?
    * Length and characters compatible with most Unix systems

# --- Descriptions --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A project or dataset folder can carry a README.md whose text is the folder's
# description. The service only reads it, for every listing. Writing it is not
# the service's business: the API writes it over WebDAV as the signed-in user,
# and people can edit it over SMB or WebDAV, so the file system decides who
# may change it. Whatever the file says is the description.
#
# The service runs as root inside folders that members can write to, so the
# file is never trusted to be what its name says: it is opened without
# following symlinks and without blocking, and only a regular file counts. A
# FIFO named README.md would otherwise hang every project listing. Nor is the
# folder: a member can put a symlink where a session folder would be, and root
# would then read the README.md of whatever folder it points at, including
# ones the member may not open. So the folder is opened first, again without
# following a symlink, and the file is opened inside it. A hard link
# is read like any other file: with `protected_hardlinks` set (see README.rst),
# nobody can link a file they could not read and write already.
